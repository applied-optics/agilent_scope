agilent_scope_1.02 - 16/10/2009

Extra function: agilent_display_channel(). Allows you to turn on or off a
channel or maths function. Useful for a couple of circumstances:

(1) ensure the channel you want to acquire data from is turned on (agetwf now
    does this)

(2) turn off unnecessary channels to optimise acquisition speed. This is
    generally intuitive... if you are performing averaging with high numbers
    of averages, you perhaps won't be surprised to hear that it takes longer
    to acquire one channel's worth of data if you have all 4 channels on, than
    if you have just that channel turned on. In some circumstances though,
    it's counter-intuitive. For example, imagine you want to grab data off
    channel 2. You have a 1kHz trigger, timebase=100ns, sample rate=10GSa/s,
    and 4096 averages. It's actually QUICKER if you have channels 1 and 2
    turned ON, rather than just channel 2. If you have channels 2 and 3 turned
    on though, it's SLOWER than if you just have channel 2 on.

agilent_scope_1.01 - 29/01/2007

No changes to the utilities. Two changes to the agilent_user library:

(1) a minor enhancement: added agilent_get_averages() function.

(2) a bug-fix, related to the changes in release 1.03 of the vxi11 library.
    If you do not use release 1.03 or later of the vxi11 library, then this
    bug-fix will not be effective.
    In agilent_get_data(), added a check (after :DIG) to see if
    vxi11_receive_data_block() returns -VXI11_NULL_READ_RESP (meaning
    instrument has ignored query but not returned aproper error). If so,
    has another go.

agilent_scope_1.00 - 06/07/2006

Initial release. Probably buggy.
